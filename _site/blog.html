      <p>This is a technique I came up with to create a helpful effect for (3/4 perspective) top-down 2D games in Godot: making objects semi-transparent when the player character moves behind them. I’m making a little game with lots of tightly-grouped buildings and secrets hidden in alleyways, so I want the player to be able to clearly see their character no matter where they are in the environment. This is a common feature in games, so I’m sharing my take on it in case it helps any other Godot beginners, and because I’m tickled by how simple it is.</p>

  <p>This is a technique I came up with to create a helpful effect for (3/4 perspective) top-down 2D games in Godot: making objects semi-transparent when the player character moves behind them. I’m making a little game with lots of tightly-grouped buildings and secrets hidden in alleyways, so I want the player to be able to clearly see their character no matter where they are in the environment. This is a common feature in games, so I’m sharing my take on it in case it helps any other Godot beginners, and because I’m tickled by how simple it is.</p>

<p>Here’s what the effect looks like:</p>

<figure class="medium">
  <img src="/assets/images/auto-transparency-godot-example.gif" alt="Auto transparency example in Godot" />
  <figcaption>
    The building becomes partly transparent when the player character moves behind it.

<p>And here’s what the scene structure looks like:</p>

<figure class="medium">
  <img src="/assets/images/godot-auto-transparency-example-scene-structure.png" alt="Auto transparency example in Godot scene structure" />
  <figcaption>
    A <code>StaticBody2D</code> with a <code>Sprite</code>, a <code>CollisionShape2D</code>, and an <code>Area2D</code> with its own <code>CollisionShape2D</code>.

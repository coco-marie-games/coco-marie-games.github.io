This is a technique I came up with to create a helpful effect for (3/4 perspective) top-down 2D games in Godot: making objects semi-transparent when the player character moves behind them. I'm making a little game with lots of tightly-grouped buildings and secrets hidden in alleyways, so I want the player to be able to clearly see their character no matter where they are in the environment. This is a common feature in games, so I'm sharing my take on it in case it helps any other Godot beginners, and because I'm tickled by how simple it is.

Here's what the effect looks like:

<figure class="medium">
  <img src="/assets/images/auto-transparency-godot-example.gif" alt="Auto transparency example in Godot">
  <figcaption>
    The building becomes partly transparent when the player character moves behind it.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

And here's what the scene structure looks like:

<figure class="medium">
  <img src="/assets/images/godot-auto-transparency-example-scene-structure.png" alt="Auto transparency example in Godot scene structure">
  <figcaption>
    A <code>StaticBody2D</code> with a <code>Sprite</code>, a <code>CollisionShape2D</code>, and an <code>Area2D</code> with its own <code>CollisionShape2D</code>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
